	<strong>
		ARORA
	</strong>
	 (Augmented Reality and Object Recognition Application) is an Android application that was developed by Michael Schlosser as part of a project at Aalen University in Germany.
	 </p>
	 <p>
	With this application it is possible to train the model for custom objects and mapping them to information and other metadata like their type and additional information. This is made possible by extending an already trained object recognition AI with additional objects using so-called Transfer Learning. This functionality can be applied in various areas such as the tourism industry, Augmented Reality games and many more.
</p>
	<p>
	A special thing about this method is that all processing happens on the mobile device without the needs of an external server. This makes it possible to use the application even without internet access.
</p>
<p>
	The object folder used is a MobilenetV2, which has been extended by a configurable Softmax layer. It is possible to change the object folder.
</p>
	More information about the configuration of a custom object folder can be found
	<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/lite/examples/model_personalization/README.md#converting-the-model-using-the-cli">
		here</a>.
	<p>
	The GitHub repository for this application can be found
